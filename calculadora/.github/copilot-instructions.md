# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Code Generation Rules

### General Structure
- Always generate complete structures in all programming languages
- Do not abbreviate control blocks like if, else, while, for, switch, try-catch
- Never use shortened versions like ternary operators or lambda expressions instead of full blocks
- Always use curly braces { } when necessary
- Maintain clear indentation
- Prioritize readability and avoid premature optimizations unless otherwise specified
- Add comments when the code requires further clarification
- Write in language: Espa√±ol

### Function Declarations
- Avoid using arrow functions when not explicitly requested
- Prefer full function declarations over concise syntax
- Maintain clarity while learning JavaScript, Python, and PHP

### Frameworks
- Do not suggest advanced frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular unless explicitly mentioned
- Focus on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for learning purposes

### Documentation
- Never create a documentation file or similar unless I ask you to
